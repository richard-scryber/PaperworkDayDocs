# CSS Style Property Reference
{: .no_toc }

Within the style attribute of a visual element, or a selector in a stylesheet or group, properties alter the actual visual apperance of the element they are on, or matched to. Each property has a name and one or more values, depending on what is being set.

<details open markdown="block">
  <summary>
    Table of contents
  </summary>
  {: .text-delta }
- TOC
{: toc}
</details>

## Property Value Keywords

The style property global values (initial, revert, inherit, etc.) are **not** supported by the library, and that property will be ignored. If there has been a value set on that property previously (or with lower precedence) then it will be maintained for the content that would have had the global value set on it. See the <a href='/learning/styles/precedence.html' >CSS Selector Precedence</a> article for more information on ordering and assigning values.

## Unsupported Properties

If the style group, style sheet or style attribute contains an unknown or unsupported property, then that property will be skipped over. However further properties that are known will still be parsed and used during document output.

## Element Spacing

* 'boxed' elements have a non pure inline display, so they encapsulate all their content within a rectangular 'box', e.g. block, or inline-block.
