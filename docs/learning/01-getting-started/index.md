## Your First PDF in 5 Minutes

Here's a simple example to show you how easy it is:

### 1. Install the Package

```bash
dotnet add package Scryber.Core
```

### 2. Create a Simple Template

{% raw %}
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First PDF</title>
    <style>
        body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 40pt; }
        h1 { color: #336699; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, {{model.name}}!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to PDF generation with Scryber.Core.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
{% endraw %}

### 3. Generate the PDF

```csharp
using Scryber.Components;

// Load the template
var doc = Document.ParseDocument("template.html");

// Pass data to the template
doc.Params["model"] = new { name = "World" };

// Generate the PDF
using (var stream = new FileStream("output.pdf", FileMode.Create))
{
    doc.SaveAsPDF(stream);
}
```
